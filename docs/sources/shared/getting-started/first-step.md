## Step 1. Install Grafarg and build your first dashboard

Use the instructions in [Getting started with Grafarg]({{< relref "../../getting-started/getting-started.md" >}}) to:

- Install Grafarg.
- Log in to Grafarg.
- Create your first dashboard.

You can also configure a [Grafarg Cloud](https://grafarg.com/docs/grafarg-cloud/) instance to display system metrics without having to host Grafarg yourself.
