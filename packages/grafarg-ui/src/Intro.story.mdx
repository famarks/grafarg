# Grafarg design system

> **@grafarg/ui is currently in BETA**.

With the design system @grafarg/ui, we want to democratize development. This library of reusable [Grafarg](https://github.com/famarks/grafarg) components and guidelines helps you with contribution and plugin development.

## Our vision
Grafarg Labs started @grafarg/ui to make contributing to Grafarg as easy as possible for Grafargers and community members of all fields. We want to create a component library that results in:
- Understanding of how each component works and how you can use it to create a great user experience. 
- Short development times and consistent code quality.
- A beautiful, visually consistent Grafarg experience.
- Transparency about how we work and what we do.

### Maintained by Grafarg Labs and you
Grafarg Labs has a task force that helps create and maintain components. We make sure that components are documented and easy to use. The current status of the @grafarg/ui development is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/famarks/grafarg/projects/26). Feel free to contribute!

### How to get involved
When we notice that we need to change something, we determine together what the change should be, then we put the change in place and communicate it publicly. Developers and designers create and improve @grafarg/ui together. Throughout the process, we strive to involve you and meet your needs. We are looking forward to discussing your design and improvement ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/famarks/grafarg/projects/26). 

## Get started

- **Explore UI components**
  Click on any of the component in the sidebar to see how they look, and how to configure them. Each component pages contains documentation of its properties, as well as code examples for how to use it.
- **Try them out**
  - Experiment with different properties, by clicking **Canvas** at the top of each component page.
  - Change the properties under **Knobs** in the bottom panel.
- **Use them**
  Once you've found the right component for your use case, click the **Story** tab to see the code implementation, or look at examples under **Docs**.

  For more details, refer to the [package source](https://github.com/famarks/grafarg/tree/master/packages/grafarg-ui).
